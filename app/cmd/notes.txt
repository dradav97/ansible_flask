#### notes #######
how to execute set_facts file if not have playbook???
First we need a main.yml file to execute all steps in the same execution

In 01_core_package.yml 


### note ######
playbook_dir
The path to the directory of the current playbook being executed. 
NOTE: This might be different than directory of the playbook passed to the ansible-playbook command 
line when a playbook contains a import_playbook statement.
